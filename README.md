Hi, I'm **Tea Hong Liang** and I stay in a town at the east side of Singapore called Tampines.

I had over 10 years of working experience as Field Engineer. Due to company restructuring, I was been layoff last year July.
<br>After that I started taking up courses in Data Science and Data Analyst, and starting to grow my passion on data.
<br>I'm currently looking to transit as a Data Analyst/Data Scienist/Data Engineer.

## Capstone Projects
Below links are the projects I did for data analyst courses:
